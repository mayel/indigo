Hi! I'm Mayel. If we were to meet randomly at a party, you might try recognising my accent and guessing where I'm from until you give up! I call myself a <a href="http://glomads.org" target="_blank">glomad</a> and recently spent five years living out of a suitcase. I'm addicted to travel and exploring the world - in the past few years I have spent time in over 20 countries, but I'm not really counting. It's less about the destinations (or about the sights), and more about the journey! I prefer staying somewhere for a while, really getting to know the culture, the people, and even how to cook the local specialities. 

I'm a developer and social entrepreneur. I enjoy hacking things to find what makes them tick, and occasionally inventing things.
