I created Commons Taxonomy of Human Needs in cooperation with various people and groups who are working to create solutions to power the commons, or solidarity economy.

It is crowd-sourced open content, powered by an API that runs open source / libre software.

You can [browse and contribute to the taxonomy](https://taxonomy.commons.mayel.space/needs), or contact me for API details if you want to integrate it into a project.
