I'm working on Commons Taxonomies of Human Needs, Goods, Tools, Knowledge, Skills, Interests, etc, in cooperation with various people and groups to power solutions for the commons, open content, interoperatibility, federation, and solidarity economies.

The data is crowd-sourced open content, powered by an API that runs open source / libre software that I've been developing.

You can [browse and contribute to the taxonomies](https://taxonomy.commons.mayel.space/taxonomies), or contact me for details if you want to integrate it into a project.
