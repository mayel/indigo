Dataverse is a user-friendly tool for creating conversational forms which store their data in dynamic databases.

As open source / libre / free software, you can self-host it on a server, using Docker and MySQL (recommended), Postgres, or SQLite. The [source is available at Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/mayel/dataverse).

If you don't have a server, I can also provide Dataverse as a service via [CloudVault](/CloudVault.html).
