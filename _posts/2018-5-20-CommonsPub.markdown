We are developing [CommonsPub](http://commonspub.org) as a building block for [MoodleNet](https://moodle.com/moodlenet) and several other projects. CommonsPub is an ActivityPub server which supports any type of activity, object and property, including any extensions to ActivityStreams. It is intended to be a server-side building block for creating multifunctional federated networks.
