[Social.coop](https://social.coop/) is a Mastodon node (a free, open-source microblogging platform). A decentralized alternative to commercial platforms, this social network combats the risks of a company monopolizing your communication. Thanks to open standards and federation protocols, you can interact with everyone else on Mastodon or GNU Social (the "fediverse"), no matter what provider they signed up with.

[Check out the Social.coop site](https://social.coop/), and sign up if you want to get involved!
