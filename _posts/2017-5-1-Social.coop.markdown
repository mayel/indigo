I'm a founding member of the [Social.coop](https://social.coop/) Mastodon instance.

Mastodon is a microblogging & social network based on open protocols and free, open-source software.

As a decentralized (like e-mail) alternative to commercial platforms, it combats the risks of a company monopolizing your communication. You can interact with everyone else on Mastodon, GNU Social, or other compatible software (together called the "fediverse"), no matter what provider each of you are using.

[Check out the Social.coop site](https://social.coop/), and sign up if you want to get involved!
