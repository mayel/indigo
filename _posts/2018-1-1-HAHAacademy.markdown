I'm a co-founder and developer of [HAHA Academy](http://HAHA.Academy/), an online education platform to index, curate, and produce freely available educational content.

HAHA is a nonprofit organisation whose mission is to empower humans of all ages to continuously follow our passions and curiosities, and become more enlightened individuals.
