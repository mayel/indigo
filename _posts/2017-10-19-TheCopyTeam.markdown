I'm a founding member of the [The Copy Team](http://thecopy.team/)

We do things differently at The Copy Team. Our wordsmiths copy-edit and translate in groups, each taking turns perfecting every sentence. The end result? The best possible version of your text.

Visit [The Copy Team](http://thecopy.team/) and contact us if you're interested in our services, or sign up if you want to get involved!
