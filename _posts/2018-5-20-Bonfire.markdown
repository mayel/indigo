## Your plug & play federated social network

> Bonfire aims to expand your freedom as a user of social networks, puts your data in your own hands (literally) and connects you with the people and communities you care about. 

We are developing [Bonfire](http://bonfire.cafe) as a set of building blocks for ActivityPub-based federated apps which support any type of activity, so you or your community can create and operate your own multifunctional federated networks.
