<p>If we were to meet randomly at a party, I could keep you guessing about my accent and where I'm from for hours on end. Having lived abroad much of my life (out of a couple suitcases for the last few years), I call myself a glomad (a word I made up). An entrepreneur with an activist streak, I enjoy taking things apart or inventing new ones, photography and (watching & sometimes making) films…

<p>I'm addicted to travel and exploring the world, in the past few years I have found myself in over 20 countries, but I'm not really counting. It’s less about the destinations (and really not about the sights), but more about the journey! I prefer staying somewhere for a while, really getting to know the culture and people…

<hr>
<p>Along the road, I've built a global community of interpreters, podcast creation and video distribution platforms and produced video content, among other fun things... 

<p>With 10+ years experience as a startup founder and 15+ years as a full-stack web app developer, I can help you define a project's strategy, design the features and architecture, build and launch websites and apps, set up and manage servers / cloud hosting, etc. 

<p>On top of my core technical skills, I've been in charge of everything from product design to project management, pitching to fundraising, hiring to project management, community building to creating a movement, branding to PR to social media, marketing to sales to customer service, etc...

<p>I was most recently co-founder/CTO of <a href="http://blog.deborniol.com/cat/babelverse/" target="_blank">Babelverse</a> – the universal translator for spoken communication, powered by polyglots around the world – a global startup that tried to revolutionise how we communicate. I presented Babelverse at dozens of international conferences and various events, won some awards (TechCrunch, LeWeb, TheNextWeb, etc), and received plenty of press coverage along the way (CNBC, FastCompany, etc). 

<p>On top of advising many friends on their projects, I also have been a mentor at multiple hackathons, accelerator programmes and Startup Weekend events around the world.
