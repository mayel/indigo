Hi! I'm Mayel. If we were to meet randomly at a party, you might try recognising my accent and guessing where I'm from until you give up! I call myself a <a href="http://glomads.org" target="_blank">glomad</a> and recently spent five years living out of a suitcase. I'm addicted to travel and exploring the world - in the past few years I have spent time in over 20 countries, but I'm not really counting. It's less about the destinations (or about the sights), and more about the journey! I prefer staying somewhere for a while, really getting to know the culture, the people, and even how to cook the local specialities. 

I'm a developer and social entrepreneur. I enjoy hacking things to find what makes them tick, and occasionally inventing things. I've had the pleasure of building a lot of fun things, including:  Podemus, a podcasting platform (back in 2005); LeLab.TV, a video platform (which I also produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW7-xYtAY3tWEeEFyRG865-RB6V9uwLs1" target="_blank">video content</a> for, including a collaboration with The Yes Men); <a href="http://blog.deborniol.com/cat/babelverse/" target="_blank">Babelverse</a>, an award-winning startup that took on the challenge of the ‘universal translator', powered by a global community of interpreters; and most recently, <a href="http://getacross.org/" target="_blank">GetAcross</a>, a non-profit project helping refugees access volunteer interpreters. 

Need help with any of these?
